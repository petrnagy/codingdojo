==== Euler Problem 1 ====
Add all the natural numbers below one thousand that are multiples of 3 or 5.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get
3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of
these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

==== Euler Problem 2 ====
Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million.
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1
and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.

==== Euler Problem 3 ====
Find the largest prime factor of a composite number.
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
