You task is to implement a tennis scoring program.
Summary of tennis scoring:

1. A game is won by the first player to have won at
   least four points in total and at least two points
   more than the opponent.
   
2. The running score of each game is described in a
   manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three
   points are described as "love", "fifteen", "thirty",
   and "forty" respectively.
   
3. If at least three points have been scored by each
   player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".
   
4. If at least three points have been scored by each
   side and a player has one more point than his opponent,
   the score of the game is "advantage" for the player
   in the lead.

==== Description ====
In this kata, we focus just on handling the scoring in a tennis game. The scoring in tennis is a back-and-forth
style, which presents a different type of scoring from other katas like "the bowling game".

=== Tennis Scoring ===

** Basics: **
In a game of tennis, a player starts with a score of 0. With each success, the player earns more points. The
points are earned in this sequence. 

0 -> 15 -> 30 -> 40

If a player has 40 and scores again that player wins the game as long as the other player does not also have
40 points. If both players reach 40 points it is referred to as "deuce".

** Deuce: **
Scoring during deuce gives a player advantage. If the other player scores again the score returns to deuce.
If a player has advantage and scores again, that player wins the game.


Requirements
Write a program to handle each of these requirements scoring a two player game of tennis.
• Players must be able to score points.
• The game must be able to be completed with a winner.
• The "deuce" case should be handled.
• After a game has been won, a winner must be determined.
• Be able to get the current score of either player at any point during the game.
